# Projects
These are various machine-learning and analytics projects I have done.

### LSTM With Attention: 

A notebook used to present on LSTMs with attention at a meetup (North Houston Data Analytics).

### Jargon Comprehension: 

A notebook used to demonstrate how vector embeddings can be used for domain specific text searches. 

### RL Bandit Coding:

This notebook executes most of the methods for solving the associative k-armed bandit problem outlined in Sutton and Barto, *Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction*. Includes object-oriented experiment code.
